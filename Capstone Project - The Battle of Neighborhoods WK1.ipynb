In total, this system manages 427 schools (an estimated 300,000 students\nstudy there annually, making the TDSB the largest school district in Canada and the fourth largest in North America).\n    \n    2.

Neighborhood Profiles\nof the city of Toronto use these census data to provide a portrait of demographic characteristics\nand economic aspects of people and households in every Toronto city neighborhood.
